      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to help people understand what is the main idea of this Store.
        I have in mind to have an open store. I mean, it will be possible to have a variety of products on this website.
        That means, whatever is so demanding on the other markets will be sold on the website because I will not
        be stuck with one product.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People with different backgrounds, genders and of course with different interests as well. <br>
        In terms of age, I would say starting from above 18 to x years old since this person is able to read
        and understand  which products she or he needs by using his or her bank card, and if he or she is so eligible
        to buy on our website.
       If someone tends to use another person's bank card, he or she has to fill the KYC form
        (Know Your Customers)  Why? Because we are all aware  of that people can use others' bank card to do 
        harmful things. We should do our best to protect our customers accordingly!
