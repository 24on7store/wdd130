    <p>Hello everyone!</p>

        <p>I hope you are fine.
        
        <p>I am very happy to be among you!</p>
        
        <p>I am currently working as a customer representative.</p>

        <p>I am doing this class to get a certificate in web and computer programming to change my career.
        And to start working as a programmer. Additionally, I would like to be a software developer because I see a lot of opportunities there if I really develop my coding skills.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies are; I love going to the gym, listening to music,  playing the guitar as a beginner, and watching movies.</p>
        
        <p>I am not a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints yet. But that cannot prevent me from visiting and having friends there!
        A quote that I have learned from one of our gathering devotionals is finish what you have started. This is really inspiring to me.
        That is why I am doing my whole best to finish what I have started.</p>
        
        <p>I am looking forward to working with you, devoted people!</p>
